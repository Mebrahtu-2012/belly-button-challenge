Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Overview
This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset highlights that a small handful of microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) are present in more than 70% of people, while the rest are relatively rare.

Instructions
Data Source:

Utilize the D3 library to read in samples.json from this URL.
Bar Chart:

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual.
Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
Bubble Chart:

Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
Use otu_ids for the x values.
Use sample_values for the y values.
Use sample_values for the marker size.
Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
Use otu_labels for the text values.
Sample Metadata:

Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
Dashboard Layout:

You are welcome to create any layout that suits your dashboard preferences.
Updates:

Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
